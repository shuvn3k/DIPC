Using test mode
***************

This is the famous (?) --test mode of operation which is similar to client mode in many ways. The main difference is that test mode runs interactively (in contrast client mode has to have all commands specified on the command line). The main use for test mode is when you have problems with your monitoring and need to troubleshoot.

Start NSClient++ in test mode and see the errors as they happen, this is otherwise difficult to detect.
